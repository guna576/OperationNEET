A low level design diagram is bulit using classes,interfaces and the relationship between classes.

In case of hld (high level design) diagram no need to give complete details about a class .we can have only a classname in a rectangular box.

A class is reprsented as a rectangle with attributes and functions.

Along with attributes we need to specify the visibility of the class varaibles .
types of visibility for the attributes :  private (-) , public (+) , protected (#)

types of relationships:

Association : It is of two types 1. UniDirectional (solidline at the end  an arrow)
                                 2. BiDirectional  (solidline)

‚úî On top of association we add the type of relation it is as one-one ,one-many,many-one and many-many relation.


Other two relationships are aggregation and composition . 

If we have two classes A and B ,

üëç Aggregation is B can exist with A . example : house and person , desktop and monitor  (Has-A relation)



üëç Composition is B cannot exist without A . example : eye exists in body (and eye cannot exist as seperate entity)  (IS-A relation )


But using this relations and identifying them in realtime scenario  is the most important part in an interview.
