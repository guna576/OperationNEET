A low level design diagram is bulit using classes and the relationship between classes.

In case of hld (high level design) diagram no need to give complete details about a class .we can have only a classname in a rectangular box.
A class is reprsented as a rectangle with attributes and functions.

Along with attributes we need to specify the visibility of the class varaibles .
types of visibility for the attributes :  private (-) , public (+) , protected (#)

types of relationships:
