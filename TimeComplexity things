if question states to complete your logic in 1 second it means the maximum vaue of n is 10^8  and if it is 2 seconds then it is 2*10^8


if t = 1 sec , N=10^8

if t = 2 sec , N=2*10^8


Few other things about different complexities :

Big O notation :  Upper Bound  (Best Case complexities)
Theta Notation : between upper and lower bound   (Average case complexities)
Omega notation : lower bound  (Worst Case complexities)
