when i was solving a problem related to datatypes , i got an issue
git 
 example x is int and y is long type and i did operation on x with the help of y like

 x=x%y i got and error because the datatype of x is int . (i need to do manual typecast of long to int and then i can perform modulo operation)


 but just i tried changing the statement to ( x%=y ) then it worked fine without any error .

 I was shocked by the above change and delved into compound assignments .

About Compound statements : 

✔ in the case of compound assignment operators internally type-casting will be performed automatically,
(There may be a data loss as bigger one is assigned to smaller ones).
✔ Efficent in terms of memory as it stores value directly to left hand variable .
✔ Evaluation is done from right to left.
✔  For clarity and maintainability, it's generally recommended to use compound assignments for simple operation

last point : you wont face any issues with type in python as we dont specify datatype in python

conclusion : Better to go for compound assignments which are helpful in many ways.
