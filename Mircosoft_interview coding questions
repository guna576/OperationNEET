1.Implementing the pow() Function  (all possible ways are linear traversal, logarithm tc logic)

b=5
p=3
ans=1
while(p>0):
    if b&1:
        ans=ans*b
    b=b*b
    p=p//2
    print(ans)
print(ans)     tc: o(logn)

2.Counting Triplets with a Sum Divisible By 3 
The second question involved finding the number of triplets in an array whose sum was divisible by 3. The array provided was:

Array: [3, 5, 7, 11, 12, 4, 2]


3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/  to solve this question in O(m+n) time we need to use two pointer .
two position are possible for our traversal  one is top right corner other one  bottom left corner .Try coding it .
